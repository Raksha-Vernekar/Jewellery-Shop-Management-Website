# Jewellery-Shop-Management-Website

Jewellery Shop Management System is an online website that helps users to shop for their
desired jewel sitting comfortably at home along with their family. These days people want
to explore as many options as they can get before spending a fortune on silver, gold,
platinum and diamond ornaments. As this process requires a lot of decision time and buyers
would not want the external pressure or unwanted suggestions from anyone other than their
loved ones, customers rather feel buying a jewellery online is better than offline. Also, when
it is offline, they might not receive appropriate amount of attention from the seller or
unavailability of some designs may reduce the number of options. So, this jewellery
management system works as a boon to both the seller and the customer. The sellers can put
up all the available designs online along with the required details, track orders from the customers,
know what they have ordered, know about the customer details, etc. On the other side, it allows the
users to have their own accounts where they can log into or register into the website in order to
access the catalogues, search for the required jewel, add it to the cart, place order, view the cart
in order to decide about it again, view the bill and save the bill for future references and logout
safely when they are done.
